# Electra_classification_fake_vs_real_news
SSLM project:
Machine generated text, despite having received a lot of popularity in recent years, has not yet reached the quality and naturalness of human writing. With this project we aim to explore the difference in classification of human versus machine-generated text using ELECTRA (an encoder-based model) over various language characteristics and compare that with the existing baseline models available for this task.
